# Hi! 👋 I'm Blake

Design Leader • Builder • Systems thinker • AI-native

I help B2B/B2C teams lead, design, and ship products end-to-end. From 0→1 discovery and **AI-copilot PoCs** to design-system architecture and launch, I drive clarity, speed, and measurable outcomes.

I partner with founders and product teams on **product strategy**, **early-stage leadership**, and **design team ops**—setting the North Star, shaping the roadmap, and delivering the first reliable slice of a design system.

## Selected work
- [Eclipse OS — Real-Time Mission Control](https://blakerzepa.com/work/eclipse-os)
I led discovery/UX and designed the mission timeline, map-linked sensors/cameras, POIs, and role-based views; set patterns and hi-fi prototypes.

- [Lexmotion — Growth Redesign & Content Engine](https://blakerzepa.com/work/lexmotion)
I owned IA and high-intent pages, coordinated 30+ expert articles, built the design system, and guided WP/Elementor rollout and QA.

- [SpacetimeOS — Operating System for Physical Spaces](https://blakerzepa.com/work/spacetimeos)
I defined product primitives and the interaction model, designed situational-awareness/alert flows, and established a cohesive design language.

- [Workplace Safety — Privacy-First Contact Tracing](https://blakerzepa.com/work/workplace-safety-contact-tracing)
I designed opt-in, privacy-first contact-tracing flows with data minimization, risk states/notifications, and role-based dashboards and consent.


## How I can help
- **AI Copilot PoC Prototyping** — Rapid, working proofs-of-concept with LLM/agent copilots (e.g., Cursor/Copilot): from prompt flows to instrumented prototypes with basic evals & telemetry — days, not weeks.
- **Early-Stage Product Leadership (0→1)** — Lead discovery and design to frame problems, define value prop, shape MVP scope, create a hypothesis backlog, and set the first design-system slice.
- **Design Team Leadership & Ops** — Build and lead the design function: hiring, rituals, critique, design-system governance, documentation, and efficient design↔dev handoff.
- **Product Strategy & Outcomes** — Establish North Star & KPIs, roadmap and prioritization, run experiments, align stakeholders, and turn insights into decision memos.
