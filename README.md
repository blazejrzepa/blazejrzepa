# Hi! 👋 I'm Blake

Design Leader • Builder • Systems thinker • AI-native

I help B2B/B2C teams lead, design, and ship products end-to-end. From 0→1 discovery and **AI-copilot PoCs** to design-system architecture and launch, I drive clarity, speed, and measurable outcomes.

I partner with founders and product teams on **product strategy**, **early-stage leadership**, and **design team ops**—setting the North Star, shaping the roadmap, and delivering the first reliable slice of a design system.


- 🔭 Now building: **Fragment UI** (AI-native design system), **CleverHive Space** (mission control UI), **AI Disclosure & Governance Checker)
- 🧠 Interests: AI in products, design systems, UX for complex B2B tools
- 🌍 Kraków, PL (remote/hybrid)

## Selected work
- **Eclipse OS — Real-Time Mission Control**
Co-created a console for lunar rover ops: timeline playback, map-linked sensors/cameras, POIs with context, and role-based views to cut communication noise and speed decisions.
- **Lexmotion — Growth Redesign & Content Engine**
Turned legal expertise into qualified leads: full site IA, high-intent hybrid pages (“Polish Citizenship by Descent”, “Polish Passport”), 30+ expert articles, a cohesive design system, and a WordPress/Elementor setup for fast iteration.
- **SpacetimeOS — Operational OS for Complex Teams**
Defined the interaction model and system primitives (timeline, layered maps, alerts) to improve situational awareness across distributed teams; delivered a consistent design system and high-fidelity flows.
- **Workplace Safety — Privacy-First Contact Tracing**
Rapid, opt-in tool for workplace exposure tracking with clear risk states, role-based access, and transparent privacy messaging to drive adoption while minimizing data collected.

## How I can help
- **AI Copilot PoC Prototyping** — Rapid, working proofs-of-concept with LLM/agent copilots (e.g., Cursor/Copilot): from prompt flows to instrumented prototypes with basic evals & telemetry — days, not weeks.
- **Early-Stage Product Leadership (0→1)** — Lead discovery and design to frame problems, define value prop/JTBD, shape MVP scope, create a hypothesis backlog, and set the first design-system slice.
- **Design Team Leadership & Ops** — Build and lead the design function: hiring, rituals, critique, quality bar, design-system governance, documentation, and efficient design↔dev handoff.
- **Product Strategy & Outcomes** — Establish North Star & KPIs, roadmap and prioritization (RICE/ICE/WSJF), run experiments, align stakeholders, and turn insights into decision memos.
